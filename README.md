The idea of ​​this repository is to develop a web application, so that the user can play a solo adventure based on the solo RPG Berdolock Fortress

## THE CUSTOMER
For this project, a fiction client needs a website where the person can play a solo RPG, but the application needs to be built only with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
In the game the player has three possibilites:

</ul>
